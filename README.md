## Open DI

This repository is a Work-in-progress effort to create a dependency injection implementation that implements CDI lite (part of the CDI 4.0 specification) using annotation processing and libraries provided by the Micronaut Open Source project.

As of this writing there is no current release of this project, it is not considered production-ready and is primarily being used as a proving ground for new concepts in CDI 4.0.

Once CDI 4.0 is stabilized and finalized an effort to implement the full spec will commence.
